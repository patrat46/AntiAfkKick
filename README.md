# AntiAfkKick
An application, Dalamud and ACT plugin for preventing being auto-kicked from FFXIV due to inactivity.

**Please use responsibly, this is meant to be used for gatherers or if you are waiting for raid/pf/event, not to just afk in limsa dancing**

## Dalamud plugin
Recommended if you are using FFXIV Quick Launcher. Using AntiAfkKick as Dalamud plugin provides advantages of automatically launching together with game and automatic updates. ACT plugin and standalone version must be updated manually if ever needed.

Add my custom repo URL: 

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eternita-S/MyDalamudPlugins/main/pluginmaster.json` 

then install plugin from plugins list.

Detailed instruction available here: https://github.com/Eternita-S/MyDalamudPlugins

## ACT plugin
Download it here: https://github.com/Eternita-S/AntiAfkKick/releases

Then copy it to any convenient folder. Open up ACT, go to "Plugins" tab, then to "Plugin Listing", then click "Browse" button and select DLL file you have just downloaded, and finally click "Add/Enable plugin". Upon doing so ACT may ask you to unblock file. In this case press "Yes".


## Standalone version
Just download it and run it. No configuration needed. To exit, access program's tray icon.

## How it works?
It just sends left control key to the game every now and then. Seems like for now it's enough to make game think user is still active. It won't send keypress if you are actually playing.

## But you can just open hud layout and you won't be kicked!
Not anymore

## Ethical side of the plugin and my personal opinion about auto-kick
Some people question ethical side of this plugin and in general are against circumventing auto-afk kicking. Here is my personal opinion about it and why I think it's OK to do so:
* First of all, many activities in FFXIV are tied to specific time windows. Once you get kicked, you aren't guaranteed that you are going to get back in without queue. Things such as gathering unspoiled and legendary nodes, fishing, waiting for specific party finder to fill or appear, waiting for hunt train require you to be in game. Just imagine that you have to sit out 15 minutes queue after seeing hunt train announcement, best case you'll be able to join it halfway.
* I would understand AFK-kicking if SE was a startup indie company which can legitimately have issues with servers and lack of funding to fix it. Or if game was free. But both statements are not true. Not only SE makes great profit from the game, they are not shy about spending these money for other projects while the one that brings them money clearly requires maintenance. In other words: they ask you to pay for game, then also pay for every month you playing and then they ask you to bear with inconveniences that are directly a result of them using your money for other projects instead of using it to make sure your experience is as uninterruptible as possible and only then using what is left for other projects. This applies not only to queues and afk kick, but for example also to bots, for example they do not put any effort to stop gathering bots that ruin gathering and crafting fun just because they don't want to pay for programmers to write anti-bot checks, to extend their "special task force" or whatever they call their anti-cheat fighting department and pay them more. 
* Based on what I said above, I conclude that I personally have full rights to circumvent afk-kick. Whether you have that right and want to use it or not, is up to you to decide. However, I do ask you to use this tool or any other tool to bypass afk-kick responsible: if you do know that you won't be playing for a good while (while sleeping or at work for example), please do still log out. 


## Patrat's Opinion
I love my characters and want them to be as alive as possible. Early on my characters would find a bed and go to sleep while I was resting. I work them pretty hard and they rarely go offline. Together they work to add entertainment for my community, while one stands guard to ensure security.

I pay for my time like everyone else. This time entitles me to 30, 60, 90 days or a year of services. When they take action against me for using this service by kicking me offline they are taking away the service I paid for without compensating me. My time is not extended when I am offline. My time is not refunded when I am in a queue. We don't pay by minute, the minimum increment we have is the month. If I am AFK for a month, feel free to pause my subscription and kick me offline, when I get back in you can start it back up again. Either that or change the terms of the subscription. If you are unable to offer the service I paid for, change the service User Agreement or product description, so I can consider my purchase better. I won't kill my characters because others believe their characters should have priority over my time.
